This repository contains my Problem submission for the module Applied Statistics.

My github repository link is as follows:

[SBCURLEY/as-assessment](https://github.com/SBCURLEY/as-assessment)

## Installation
I had to install the below to get started on this repository
- Python 
- Visual Studio Code
- Cmder
- Jupyter notebook
- github

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to execute my notebook:
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Essential for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is closely integrated with NumPy and provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and visualizations.
- `numpy`: It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations.
- `pandas`: Fundamental data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- `math`: This module provides access to common mathematical functions and constants.
- `itertools`: This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.
- `random`: This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
- `scipy.stats`: This module contains a large number of probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests, masked statistics, kernel density estimation, quasi-Monte Carlo functionality, and more.
- `statsmodels`: It provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
- `seaborn`: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Using python, import the following as per notebook:

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`import numpy as np`

`import pandas as pd`

`import math`

`import itertools`

`import random`

`import scipy.stats as stats`

`import statsmodels as sm`

`import seaborn as sns`


## Usage
Once the above is installed, you can run the notebook for the project `problems.ipynb`

## Repository Structure

- Images folder: contains images used for the Readme & the problems notebook
- roughwork
- gitignore
- problems.ipynb. The Problems are contained in this Jupyter Notebook. 

The Problems notebook is structured as follows:

1. Description

## About Author
- Sharon Curley
  
    My role is a Business Systems Analyst for [Meissner Corporation](https://www.meissner.com/) - a manufacturing company in Castlebar, Co. Mayo. The systems I am supporting currently are Microsoft Dynamics 365 (ERP) for all Meissner entities (Ireland, US, Switzerland, Germany & Italy). I initially started out in functional areas,  Customer Service & Supply Chain. I was lucky to be one of the first crew members on board in this company in 2020. I have moved into the IT Dept since March last year. I have a background in SAP - projects & support, so was drawn back into this area when I saw the opportunity arise within Meissner. I have a keen interest in data as when I was a functional user that was the most challenging part of my role - trying to get meaningful data from the systems we use. I have used excel to an advanced level and started with Power BI. I see a lot of opportunities within Meissner to develop in the Data field. I am hoping I will have the skills to do so.
